# dask-memusage

If you're using Dask with tasks that use a lot of memory, RAM is your bottleneck for parallelism.
That means you want to know how much memory each task uses:

1. So you can set the highest parallelism level (process or threads) for each machine, given available to RAM.
2. In order to know where to focus memory optimization efforts.

`dask-memusage` is an MIT-licensed statistical memory profiler for Dask's Distributed scheduler that can help you with both these problems.

`dask-memusage` polls your processes for memory usage and records the minimum and maximum usage in a CSV:

## Usage

*Important:* Make sure your workers only have a single thread! Otherwise the results will be wrong.

### Installation

On the machine where you are running the Distributed scheduler, run:

```console
$ pip install dask_memusage
```

### API usage

```python
# Add to your Scheduler object, which is e.g. your LocalCluster's scheduler
# attribute:
from dask_memoryusage import install
install(scheduler, "/tmp/memusage.csv")
```

### CLI usage

```console
$ dask-scheduler --preload dask_memusage --memusage.csv /tmp/memusage.csv
```

## Limitations

* Again, make sure you only have one thread per worker process.
* This is statistical profiling, running every 10ms.
  Tasks that take less than that won't have accurate information.
